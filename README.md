## 🧈 About

**Butter Launcher** is a modern, launcher for Hytale built with **Electron, React, and Vite**. 

Created after the game's release in early 2026, Butter Launcher aims to provide features that the official launcher lacks, giving power back to the players. We prioritize performance and flexibility.

### Key Features

* **⚡ Multiple Instances:** Keep your versions, pre-release versions, and soon server-specific clients completely separate!
* **🔓 Instant Access:** No official account required. Simply enter your username and play immediately.
* **🎮 Discord Rich Presence:** Show off what you are playing, version, and elapsed time directly on your Discord profile.
* **🚀 Modern Stack:** Built on a robust TypeScript base, ensuring a snappy and bug-free experience.

## 🌐 Community & Support

Join the revolution! We are building the **largest open community** for Hytale players.
