## 🧈 Why Butter?

Butter Launcher isn't just a tool to open the game; it's a complete ecosystem designed to replace the need for file managers, external chat apps, and confusing server setups. 

Built with **Electron, React, and Vite**, we offer a unified experience for **Official Account users**.

## 💎 The Ultimate Feature Set

We've packed everything you need into one beautiful interface.

### 🔓 Accessibility & Freedom
* **Universal Access:** Full support for official Hytale accounts.
* **Steam Deck Ready:** A dedicated compatibility mode ensures seamless play on handheld devices.
* **Multi-Language:** The launcher speaks your language. Choose the interface that fits you best.

### ⚡ Performance & Management
* **Smart Updates:** Stop wasting bandwidth. Our intelligent patching system downloads *only* the files that changed (saving you from redownloading 1.7GB every update).
* **Storage Control:** Choose exactly where to install the game (perfect for managing secondary hard drives).
* **Time Machine:** Play the latest Release, Pre-releases, or roll back to older versions instantly.
* **News Hub:** Stay updated with the latest Hytale news and Launcher patch notes directly on your dashboard.

### 🧠 In-Game Knowledge

* **One-Click Install:** Browse mods by popularity, relevance, or date. View images and install versions directly.
* **Profile Manager:** Create isolated "Modpacks" so your main world never breaks.
* **Magic Export System:** Share your modpack with a friend using a simple **Short Code**. They paste it, and the launcher installs the *exact* mod list and versions automatically.
* **Toggle Control:** Enable or disable specific mods at will without deleting them.

### 🌍 Multiplayer & Social (Powered by Matcha!)
* **Server Browser:** A curated list of servers, filterable by game modes and community tags.
* **Matcha! Social Network:** Add friends, chat privately, or use the **Global Chat** to find new squadmates.
