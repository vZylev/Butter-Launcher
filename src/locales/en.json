      "body": "Preamble\nWelcome to Matcha!, the social infrastructure powering your Butter Launcher experience. By registering an account, accessing the platform, or utilizing our communication services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and unconditionally agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service (\"Terms\").\n\n1. Account Security & Registration\n1.1. Account Identity\nYour user profile is distinctively identified by a username combined with a numeric discriminator (e.g., User#0000). You acknowledge that you are the sole authorized user of your account and are fully responsible for all activities, actions, and communications that occur under your credentials.\n\n1.2. Credential Protection\nWhile Matcha! employs industry-standard encryption protocols to protect your data, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials. Matcha! assumes no liability for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized access attributable to your failure to secure your password.\n\n1.3. Registration Constraints\nTo ensure service integrity and prevent abuse, account creation is strictly limited to one (1) new account per IP address within a 24-hour period. Any attempt to circumvent this restriction—including but not limited to the use of VPNs, proxies, or IP spoofing— constitutes a violation of these Terms and may result in a permanent ban.\n\n2. User Conduct & Acceptable Use\n2.1. Automated Content Filtering\nThe platform utilizes automated filtering systems to maintain community standards. Any deliberate attempt to bypass these filters (e.g., through the use of \"leet speak,\" special characters, or misspelling) is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate administrative action.\n\n2.2. Anti-Spam & Automation\nTo prevent service disruption, we enforce strict rate limits on message transmission. The use of bots, macros, scripts, or any third-party software to automate interactions or \"flood\" the chat service is prohibited.\n\n2.3. Prohibited Content\nWe maintain a zero-tolerance policy regarding:\n\nHate speech and discriminatory language.\n\nThreats of violence or harm.\n\nDoxing (the unauthorized publication of private or identifying information).\n\nHarassment or bullying in any form.\n\n3. Data Privacy & Processing\n3.1. Message Retention\nBy using the service, you consent to the processing and storage of your communications (including Global Chat and Direct Messages) on our servers. This data retention is necessary to facilitate message history synchronization across user sessions.\n\n3.2. Connection Logging\nFor the purposes of security, auditing, and moderation, you acknowledge that we log specific connection data, including the IP address utilized at the time of registration and the IP address associated with your most recent connection.\n\n4. Limitation of Liability & Disclaimer\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.\n\n4.1. User Interactions\nMatcha! and its administrators act solely as a conduit for communication. We are not responsible for, nor do we arbitrate, disputes, conflicts, or agreements between users. You assume full responsibility for your interactions with other account holders.\n\n4.2. Third-Party Content\nWe disclaim all liability regarding external links, files, or media shared by users within Global Chat or Direct Messages. Accessing third-party content is done entirely at your own risk.\n\n4.3. Limitation of Damages\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, the creators, operators, and affiliates of Matcha! shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages resulting from your use of the service. This includes, without limitation, damages for emotional distress, loss of data, or damages resulting from fraudulent actions by other users.\n\n4.4. \"As Is\" Service\nThe platform is provided on an \"AS IS\" and \"AS AVAILABLE\" basis without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted service and are not liable for data loss or message delivery failures caused by technical malfunctions, maintenance, or server restarts.\n\n5. Moderation & Termination\nThe System Administrators reserve the exclusive right, at their sole discretion and without prior notice, to:\n\nRemove or obscure content deemed inappropriate or in violation of these Terms.\n\nUnilaterally modify usernames that are offensive or violate community standards.\n\nSuspend, restrict, or permanently terminate any account found to be in violation of these Terms or that poses a threat to the security or safety of the community."
